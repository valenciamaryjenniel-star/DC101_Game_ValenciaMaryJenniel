## Description
Rock, Paper, and Scissors – is a turn-based browser game that adds a strategic twist to the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors. Instead of the player choosing moves one at a time, the player must pre-pick all 5 moves in advance, encouraging planning and prediction. To add flexibility, the game allows players to undo a selected move up to three times only, making every decision important. The goal is to outsmart the opponent by carefully selecting and managing limited moves within the given constraints.

## Instructions
1.Prepare to select your moves.  
2.Pre-pick exactly 5 moves (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) before the round begins.  
3.Selected moves will appear as cards in order.  
4.You may undo a selected move, but this is limited to 3 undos per game.  
5.Once all 5 moves are locked in, the player must click (start game).  
6.Each move will be played one by one against the opponent.  
7.The winner of each round is determined using standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:  
Rock beats Scissors  
Scissors beats Paper  
Paper beats Rock  
8.After all 5 moves are played, the final score is shown and the winner is declared.
